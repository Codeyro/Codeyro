👋 Hi, I’m @Codeyro • Make it easier  
👀 I’m interested in design and programming on Python, c+, HTML, CSS.     
🛠 I also enjoy creating robots and other interesting devices.

💞️ I'm interested in collaborating on the development of desktop and web applications.   
📫 You can write to me on E-mail: codeyroc@gmail.com   
✨ Fun fact: If a cat likes to sleep on the keyboard, it means that in a previous life he was a programmer.
